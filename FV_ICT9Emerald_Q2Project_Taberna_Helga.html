<br>
		 <center><div id="div2">
		 	<p id="p1"><span class="text2"> The Philippines is known for having <b> 7,641 </b> islands. The beauty of our country's many beaches, and tourist destinations are some of the best characteristics of our country. Scroll down to see some of the best places to visit in the Philippines.</span></p>
		 </div></center>

		 <div>
 		 <div id="div3">
		 	<p class="p2"><b><center>Siargao</center></b>
		 	Siargao’s focal point for visitors is General Luna (GL), while the island’s main town, Dapa Town, has grocery shops, a pharmacy, restaurants and cafés.<br><br>
	        Outside these, the island remains largely untouched by tourism. Perfect for those that love kayaking, paddleboarding, cliff jumping, cave swimming, island hopping and plenty more besides with lots of eco-friendly accommodation.</p></div>

	     <div id="div5">
	 	    <p class="p2"><b><center>Palawan</center></b>
	 	    Palawan’s best-known spots are El Nido and Coron with their spectacular dive sites, but there are also more off-the-beaten-track locations such as Port Barton, Taytay, Roxas, Brooke’s Point and San Vicente to discover, with their promise of authentic food and local experiences including wildlife sanctuary visits. <br><br>

            Meanwhile, the capital Puerto Princesa City is a great place to soak up some history at the Immaculate Conception Cathedral and WWI site Plaza Cuartel, as well as to shop and eat.</p></div>

	 <div id="div7">
	 	<p class="p2"><b><center>Cebu</center></b>
	 	Cebu City – a smaller, more relaxed version of Manila – has the benefit of direct international flights. The Philippines’ oldest city and first capital, it’s also chock-a-block with 16th-century Spanish colonial relics. <br><br>

	 	Cebu, along with Bohol, are accessible destinations in the glorious Central Visayas region, with the greatest choice of things to see and do. But they also serve as hopping points to thousands of spectacular smaller islands within their provinces and the rest of the region.</p> </div>
